[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves) is a complex ASCII-based game, somewhat of a cross between a [Roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) and [SimCity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity). Although a [mode](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Adventurer_mode) closely resembling a traditional rogulike exists, the bulk of Dwarf Fortress is a worldbuilding simulation. Despite the primitive appearing graphics, Dwarf Fortress has a from-scratch procedural terrain generation system, a combat system including detailed damage modeling to limbs and organs, and a world populated by massive arrays of potential enemies and trading partners.

The unofficial slogan of Dwarf Fortress is "Losing is Fun!". There is no end goal other than survival, and on a great enough timeline, chances of survival drop to zero. Between the start of the game and the end, the usual gameplay revolves around taking a small colony of dwarves, constructing a fortress for them, and building enough workshops, mushroom farms, beehives, screw presses, magma forges, and distilleries to keep them happy. Keeping dwarves happy is surprisingly difficult, as each dwarf in the game has their own personality, likes and dislikes, skillset, and basic needs. They can fall in love, get married, have children, get depressed, go into murderous rages and wipe out their fellows, and commandeer workshops to build strange artifacts that may very well be useless. How the fortress is built is largely up to the player; one could, say, build a single tunnel from the surface straight down to the magma core, or make a series of caves just below. 

A [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/magazine/the-brilliance-of-dwarf-fortress.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all) called Dwarf Fortress "perhaps the most complex video game ever made", and to say the game has a steep learning curve would be a serious understatement. The interface calls to mind word processor software from the 1980s, and the lack of a goal and the tendency for dwarves to be wiped out due to rampaging demons or goblin hordes may discourage some players. However, fans of similarly seemingly-purposeless games such as [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) may feel right at home with the open world plotless concept and [like](http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/09/minecraft-users-go-wild-building-cpus-in-their-virtual-world-vi/) Minecraft, players have [done astonishing and wonderful things](http://www.geekosystem.com/dwarf-fortress-turing-machine-computer/) with the game.
